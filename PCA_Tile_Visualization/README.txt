This directory contains a code notebook that reduces features from 5 dimensionality into 3 dimensionality.
Additionally, these 3-dimensional vectors are scaled to RGB values (0-255), and plotted onto a tile format.
This provides an easy visual for what a tile represents, in a way that a human can understand a little better.

Please note this code is NOT required for any model construction. It was going to be used for a CNN implementation,
however we pivoted away from this idea. However, the code still provides a useful visual for a tile, so it was left
in the repository.
