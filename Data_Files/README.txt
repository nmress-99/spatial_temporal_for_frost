These are the data files for the individual locations used for model construction. 
Please note that the files here MUST be combined in order to use for model building/fitting.
The combined data file is too large to upload to GitHub. Thus, the user is responsible for concatenating files together.
Alternatively, running the data extraction code will combine and export the data by default.
